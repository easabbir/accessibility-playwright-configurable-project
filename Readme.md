# Accessibility Playwright Configurable Project

This project uses Playwright to run accessibility tests.

## How to Run the Tests

1. Install dependencies (if not already done):

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Run the accessibility test:

    ```bash
    npx playwright test tests/usingFixture.test.js
    ```

## View the Accessibility Report

After running the tests, check the `accessiblitity-report` folder for the generated accessibility reports.
